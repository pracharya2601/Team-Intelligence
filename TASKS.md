# TASKS.md — Bora build tracker

The **living checklist** for Bora, derived from [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) (the full design) and split per
[`WORK-SPLIT.md`](WORK-SPLIT.md). This is the single source of truth for *what's being worked on now*.

> **Update rule (both devs + Claude):** when you start a task, mark it `🔄`; when it's done +
> verified, flip it to `- [x]`. Add new tasks as they appear. Keep this file current in the **same
> commit** as the work. PLAN.md = design (stable); WORK-SPLIT.md = strategy; **TASKS.md = live state**.

**Legend** — `- [ ]` todo · `🔄` in progress · `- [x]` done & verified · ⛔ blocked (reason)
**Owners** — **[A]** Track A (Meetings & Voice) · **[B]** Track B (Org/Chat/Knowledge) · **[A+B]** both

---

## Phase 0 — Backend + scaffold  *(≈90% — see [`PHASE_0.md`](PHASE_0.md))*

**Done (live on `app_91v2kzy0pe03`, region us-east-1):**
- [x] Butterbase app created · 10-table schema applied (all tables reachable)
- [x] RLS configured — chat user-isolation, org-scoped reads, admin-only writes, service bypass
- [x] Realtime enabled on `transcript_segments`, `bot_state`
- [x] AI gateway `allowedModels` set (default `gemini-2.5-flash`, chat `claude-opus-4.8`) + service key minted
- [x] Integrations enabled: Gmail + GitHub
- [x] Vite SPA + functions scaffold committed (`129f389`)
- [x] CORS allows `http://localhost:5173`; email/password auth endpoint live
- [x] Gateway proven: both Claude + Gemini reply via `/chat/completions`

**Remaining — Lane 1: Local & Verify  [A+B, service key only]**
- [x] Fix `scripts/check.ts` — now standalone (loads `.env.local`), uses `functions/_shared/{bb,llm}`, soft-warns on RAG
- [x] Fix `.env.example` — `VITE_*` vars added, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` dropped, port 5173, placeholders only (real keys → `.env.local`)
- [x] `npm install` → `.env.local` key set → `npm run check` green (data API + both models) → `npm run dev` boots (SPA serves 200)
- [x] **Auth round-trip verified**: signup → login returns a valid JWT (email/password; works pre-verification)
- [x] **org-create verified deployed + working**: creates org + admin member + bot (direct SQL)
- [x] **RLS org-scoping proven**: user A sees their org; non-member B sees nothing
- [ ] Finish two-user RLS proof: B can't read A's **chat** rows; non-admin can't insert `context_source`
- [ ] RAG round-trip (⛔ blocked — see Phase 4 RAG-route note below)
- [ ] Smoke **Xtrace** connectivity once `XTRACE_API_KEY`/`XTRACE_ORG_ID` exist

> ⚠️ **RAG route finding (Phase 4, [B]):** data-plane `POST /rag/collections` and
> `POST /rag/{c}/documents` both **404**. `org-create`'s RAG-collection step silently no-ops, so
> no per-org collection is created. Ingestion must use MCP `manage_rag_content` or a function-runtime
> RAG API — confirm before building `ingest-source`.

**Remaining — Lane 2: Backend deploy & Auth  [needs Butterbase account / MCP]**
- [ ] Deploy `org-create` function (creates per-org RAG `shared` collection + Xtrace group + bot + admin member)
- [ ] Deploy the SPA to Butterbase → live `*.butterbase.dev` URL
- [ ] Add deployed domain to CORS allowed origins
- [ ] ⛔ **Google OAuth**: Google Cloud client (redirect `…/auth/app_91v2kzy0pe03/oauth/google/callback`) → `manage_oauth configure` → test login *(blocked: needs Google creds)*
- [ ] Share missing vendor keys (Xtrace, etc.) into the team secret store

**Handoff:** Lane 2 `org-create` deploy → unblocks Lane 1 full e2e (signup → create org → RLS proof).

---

## Phase 1 — Org/Admin console + auth UI  **[B]**

- [ ] Auth pages: login/signup via Butterbase (`pages/Login.tsx`, `pages/AuthCallback.tsx` exist — finish)
- [ ] Google sign-in button → `/auth/{app}/oauth/google?redirect_to=…`; callback stores tokens *(after OAuth #9)*
- [ ] Create-organization flow (creator → `org_members` admin) — `org-create` function
- [ ] **Invite by Gmail** (admin only): insert `org_members` `status=invited`; flip to `active` on first matching Google login
- [ ] Promote-to-admin / member management (admin only)
- [ ] App shell nav + router in `App.tsx`: Chat · Meetings · Context · Members · (admin) Settings
- [ ] Role gating in **UI and at the API** (RLS) — members can't add context / call the bot
- [ ] **Verify:** admin creates org → invites member → member joins → role gating holds in UI + API

---

## Phase 2 — Passive meeting bot (Recall capture → recap)  **[A]**

- [ ] `functions/_shared/recall.ts`: `createBot({ meetingUrl, joinAt, recordingConfig, realtimeTranscription, outputVideoUrl })`, `getBot(id)`
- [ ] "Call the bot" UI (admin, `pages/Meetings.tsx`): paste Meet/Zoom/Teams URL (+ optional `join_at`)
- [ ] Server path: insert `meetings` row + Recall Create Bot with `output_video` → `…/bot/{meetingId}`
- [ ] `functions/recall-webhook.ts` (http): **dedupe** `ctx.idempotency.claim(event.id, {scope:'recall'})`
- [ ] Webhook: status events → update `meetings.status`
- [ ] Webhook: real-time transcript events → insert `transcript_segments`
- [ ] Webhook: on **done** → Recall Retrieve → store video/audio/transcript urls in `meeting_artifacts` + `recap_token`
- [ ] On done → **AI-notes** (Claude): summary, decisions, action items, risks → `ai_notes`
- [ ] On done → call `sendRecapEmail({orgId, meetingId})` (B's stub)
- [ ] Recap page `pages/Recap.tsx` (`/recap/:token`): org-gated (RLS) + optional signed-public; embed video + notes + transcript
- [ ] **Verify:** real Meet link → bot joins → transcript streams → end → artifacts + notes → recap renders

---

## Phase 3 — Proactive cascade (Nebius → Gemini Flash) + two-gate state machine  **[A]**  *(highest risk)*

- [ ] Nebius trigger service (`functions/trigger.ts` inline **or** FastAPI sidecar on Nebius — decide on latency)
- [ ] `SpeakDecision` contract: Pydantic (authoritative, Nebius side) + **zod** mirror (Node side)
- [ ] Trigger: consume rolling transcript window (debounced per N segments / on silence) → emit `SpeakDecision`
- [ ] `functions/_shared/escalate.ts` (Gemini Flash): (a) `speak_now` answer via fast retrieval; (b) `should_i_speak>0.7` compose correction sentence
- [ ] Bot cam page `pages/BotCam.tsx` (`/bot/:meetingId`, public tokenized): WS subscribe `bot_state`; states idle→listening→✋hand_raised→speaking + caption
- [ ] Live console `pages/MeetingLive.tsx` (`/meetings/:id/live`): transcript WS, `pending_text`+`reason`, **"Go"** button → `gate_open=true`
- [ ] `functions/speak-trigger.ts`: fires when `speak_now` **or** (`should_i_speak>0.7` **and** `gate_open`); ElevenLabs PCM → Recall Output Audio; caption; reset gates; `last_spoke_at` cooldown
- [ ] **Verify:** "Bora, …?" → `speak_now` → Gemini answers immediately (no Claude in meeting)
- [ ] **Verify:** unsolicited contradiction → `should_i_speak>0.7` → ✋ preview → Go → speaks; gate closed → silent
- [ ] **Verify:** Nebius runs every window, Gemini only past 0.7 (check call counts — cost gate)

---

## Phase 4 — Private chat + Xtrace two-tier memory + RocketRide ingestion  **[B]**

- [ ] `functions/_shared/agent.ts`: agent loop on Butterbase gateway (Claude, OpenAI-compatible tool-calling)
- [ ] Agent tools: `recall_team_memory`, `recall_my_memory` (scoped to `user_id`), `search_context` (`rag_query`), `search_meetings`, Gmail (connected users)
- [ ] System prompt **forbids** revealing another user's private chat
- [ ] Chat UI `pages/Chat.tsx` + `functions/chat.ts`: persist `chat_threads`/`chat_messages` (RLS-private)
- [ ] After each turn → write to **Xtrace** per-user scope (never shared)
- [ ] `functions/_shared/memory.ts` two-tier helpers (exists) — wire into chat + meetings
- [ ] Context ingestion: `functions/ingest-source.ts` → RocketRide fetch/parse (`tool_http_request` / GitHub tool / `parse`) → chunk
- [ ] Ingestion → write chunks to org's Butterbase RAG `shared` collection (store `rag_doc_ids`) + key facts → shared Xtrace; mark source `ready`
- [ ] `check.ts` per RocketRide rules
- [ ] **Verify:** add GitHub URL + website → pending→ready → ask question only answerable from source → cited answer
- [ ] **Verify:** user A's private fact recalled for A but **never** for user B

---

## Phase 5 — Slack (Photon Spectrum) + recap email  **[B]**

- [ ] `functions/_shared/slack.ts` + `functions/slack-event.ts`: Spectrum Slack provider; on **tag** → run `runChatAgent` → `space.send(reply)` in thread
- [ ] Map Slack `team_id`/user → org/bot via `bots.slack_team_id`; Slack uses **shared** team memory (never private)
- [ ] `functions/recap-email.ts`: Gmail `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` → email org admins on meeting end (summary + decisions + actions + recap link)
- [ ] Cron `daily-recap` function: batch "today's meetings" digest
- [ ] **Verify:** tag Bora in Slack → in-thread project-aware reply
- [ ] **Verify:** end a meeting → admin inbox gets recap email with working link

---

## Phase 6 — Hardening & polish  **[A+B]**

- [ ] [A] Recall **scheduling** via `join_at` (don't join on-demand at scale)
- [ ] [A] Cascade rate-limit + cost guard; tune the 0.7 threshold + cooldown per org
- [ ] [A] Recap link token-expiry handling; "regenerate link" + public/private toggle
- [ ] [A] App-level logging for bot-speak actions
- [ ] [B] Webhook idempotency cleanup cron (`DELETE FROM _idempotency_keys WHERE expires_at < now()`)
- [ ] [B] Rely on Butterbase audit logs for auth events; review

---

## End-to-end verification (the whole system)  **[A+B]**

- [ ] 1. Admin signs up (Google) → creates org → invites teammate Gmail → teammate joins active
- [ ] 2. Admin adds GitHub repo + docs URL → both reach `ready` (RocketRide → RAG + shared Xtrace)
- [ ] 3. Admin pastes Meet link → Bora joins, shows status page as camera, streams transcript
- [ ] 4. "Bora, …?" → speak_now → Gemini answers + ElevenLabs immediately; unsolicited → ✋ → Go → speaks
- [ ] 5. Meeting ends → recap page (video + notes + transcript) → admins get recap email
- [ ] 6. Member private chat answers from shared + own private memory; another member can't see it
- [ ] 7. Tag Bora in Slack → in-thread reply from shared team knowledge
